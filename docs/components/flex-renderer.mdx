Renders MuJoCo flex (deformable) bodies. Currently renders as a point cloud since triangle face data is not yet available in the JS bindings.

## Usage

```tsx
<MujocoCanvas config={config}>
  <SceneRenderer />
  <FlexRenderer />
</MujocoCanvas>
```

## Props

`FlexRenderer` takes no props.

## How It Works

1. Creates a `BufferGeometry` per flex body
2. Updates vertex positions from `data.flexvert_xpos` every frame
3. Renders as a `Points` material (point cloud)

## Limitations

<Warning>
  `flex_face` (triangle indices) is not available in mujoco-js 0.0.7. Flex bodies render as point clouds instead of solid meshes. This will be resolved when the binding adds face data support.
</Warning>

## Notes

- If the model has no flex bodies, this component renders nothing
- Point size and color use sensible defaults
