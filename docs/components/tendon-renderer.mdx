Renders MuJoCo tendons as smooth tube geometry. Useful for visualizing tendon-driven systems (e.g., robotic hands).

## Usage

```tsx
<MujocoCanvas config={config}>
  <SceneRenderer />
  <TendonRenderer />
</MujocoCanvas>
```

## Props

`TendonRenderer` takes no props. Tendons are rendered with default styling.

## How It Works

1. On model load, creates one `Mesh` per tendon with a shared `MeshStandardMaterial` and initial `TubeGeometry`
2. Each frame, updates the `CatmullRomCurve3` control points from `data.wrap_xpos`
3. Rebuilds only the `TubeGeometry` from the updated curve — the material and mesh objects are reused
4. Tendons with fewer than 2 valid wrap points are hidden automatically

## Defaults

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Color | `rgb(0.3, 0.3, 0.8)` |
| Tube radius | `0.002` |
| Radial segments | `6` |

## Notes

- Requires tendons defined in the MJCF model
- `ten_rgba` and `ten_width` are not available in mujoco-js 0.0.7 — defaults are used instead
- If the model has no tendons, this component renders nothing
- Meshes and material are created once and reused — only geometry is rebuilt per frame
