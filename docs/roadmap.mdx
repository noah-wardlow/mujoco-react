## Planned Features

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Multi-robot scenes" icon="robot">
    Support multiple independent robot configs in a single scene with per-robot IK and control contexts.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Physics worker thread" icon="microchip">
    Move `mj_step` to a Web Worker for truly independent physics and render rates, enabling higher-fidelity simulations without frame drops.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Mesh decimation" icon="compress">
    Automatic mesh simplification for visual geoms to reduce GPU load on complex Menagerie models.
  </Card>
  <Card title="useConstraint hook" icon="link">
    Declarative equality constraints (weld, connect, joint) that can be added/removed at runtime from React components.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Offscreen rendering" icon="camera">
    Headless canvas rendering for automated data collection, CI testing, and server-side image generation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="URDF import" icon="file-import">
    Load robots from URDF files (with automatic MJCF conversion) for ROS ecosystem compatibility.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multiplayer sync" icon="users">
    WebSocket-based state synchronization for collaborative simulation viewing and multi-operator teleoperation.
  </Card>

## Known Limitations

### WASM Binding Gaps (mujoco-js 0.0.7)

These are limitations of the underlying `mujoco-js` WASM bindings, not mujoco-react itself:

| Feature | Status | Impact |
|---------|--------|--------|
| `flex_face` | Not exposed | FlexRenderer renders as point cloud, not solid mesh |
| `ten_rgba`, `ten_width` | Not exposed | TendonRenderer uses hardcoded color/width |
| `mj_ray` body filtering | Not exposed | Raycasts hit all geoms (no body exclusion) |
| `mjv_scene` rendering | Not available | No native MuJoCo rendering pipeline (Three.js only) |

### Browser Constraints

- **WASM memory**: Large models (100+ bodies) may approach browser WASM memory limits
- **Contact reads**: Accessing `data.contact` with high `ncon` can cause OOM — always check `data.ncon` first
- **Single thread**: Physics runs on the main thread (Web Worker support planned)
- **No GPU compute**: MuJoCo's GPU pipeline is not available in WASM

### Architecture Notes

- `SceneConfig.config` is read on mount only — prop changes after mount require `api.loadScene()`
- All mutable state lives in refs to avoid 60fps re-renders — hooks return `RefObject`, not state values
- `qfrc_applied` is zeroed each frame by the provider — always **add** to it, never assign
