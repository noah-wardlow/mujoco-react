By default, MuJoCo contact parameters are tuned for collision, not grasping. Objects will slide out of grippers when lifted unless you increase friction and tighten the contact solver.

## Required Contact Parameters

Add these to your `SceneObject` definitions:

```tsx
const config: SceneConfig = {
  robotId: 'franka_emika_panda',
  sceneFile: 'scene.xml',
  sceneObjects: [{
    name: 'cube',
    type: 'box',
    size: [0.025, 0.025, 0.025],
    position: [0.4, 0, 0.025],
    rgba: [0.9, 0.2, 0.15, 1],
    mass: 0.05,
    freejoint: true,
    friction: '1.5 0.3 0.1',
    solref: '0.01 1',
    solimp: '0.95 0.99 0.001 0.5 2',
    condim: 4,
  }],
};
```

## What Each Parameter Does

### `friction: '1.5 0.3 0.1'`

MuJoCo friction has three components: `[sliding, torsional, rolling]`. High sliding friction (1.5+) prevents the object from slipping through the gripper fingers.

### `condim: 4`

Contact dimensionality. The default (3) uses a friction pyramid, but `condim: 4` enables full elliptic friction cone with torsional friction — critical for maintaining grip when the object is rotated or lifted.

### `solref: '0.01 1'`

Solver reference parameters `[timeconst, dampratio]`. A short time constant (0.01) makes contacts stiff — the object doesn't slowly push through the gripper.

### `solimp: '0.95 0.99 0.001 0.5 2'`

Solver impedance `[dmin, dmax, width, midpoint, power]`. Tight values (0.95–0.99) mean the constraint is enforced aggressively with minimal penetration.

### `mass: 0.05`

Keep mass low. Heavy objects need proportionally stronger grip forces, which may exceed what position-controlled grippers can provide.

### `freejoint: true`

Required for the object to move freely in the scene. Without this, the object is welded to the world body.

## Without These Parameters

If you omit `condim: 4` and friction settings:

- The gripper can close around the object
- Lifting causes the object to slide out immediately
- The object may tunnel through the gripper fingers

## Full Example

```tsx
const graspableObjects: SceneObject[] = [
  {
    name: 'red_cube',
    type: 'box',
    size: [0.025, 0.025, 0.025],
    position: [0.4, 0.0, 0.025],
    rgba: [0.9, 0.2, 0.15, 1],
    mass: 0.05,
    freejoint: true,
    friction: '1.5 0.3 0.1',
    solref: '0.01 1',
    solimp: '0.95 0.99 0.001 0.5 2',
    condim: 4,
  },
  {
    name: 'green_cube',
    type: 'box',
    size: [0.025, 0.025, 0.025],
    position: [0.35, 0.1, 0.025],
    rgba: [0.15, 0.8, 0.3, 1],
    mass: 0.05,
    freejoint: true,
    friction: '1.5 0.3 0.1',
    solref: '0.01 1',
    solimp: '0.95 0.99 0.001 0.5 2',
    condim: 4,
  },
];

const config: SceneConfig = {
  robotId: 'franka_emika_panda',
  sceneFile: 'scene.xml',
  gripperActuatorName: 'gripper',
  sceneObjects: graspableObjects,
};
```

## Tips

- **Smaller objects** are easier to grasp — they fit better between gripper fingers
- **Lower mass** reduces the force needed to hold the object
- **Spheres** are harder to grasp than cubes — cubes have flat faces that create better contact patches
- Use `<ContactMarkers />` or `<Debug showContacts />` to visualize contacts and verify the gripper is making good contact
